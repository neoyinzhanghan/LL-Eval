H19-5749,"Bone Marrow, RPIC, Biopsy","1-2. Bone marrow, right posterior iliac crest, biopsy and aspirate smears:
 - Systemic mastocytosis.
 - Mildly hypercellular marrow with trilineage maturing hematopoiesis and no increase in blasts. 
 
COMMENT: The patient has a recent skin biopsy showing cutaneous mastocytosis (S19-41472, 6/18/2019). The current bone marrow shows few small clusters of spindled mast cells with atypical expression of CD2 and CD25 by flow cytometry, involving less than 5% of marrow cellularity by immunohistochemical stains. Correlation with serum tryptase level and pending molecular studies (IMPACT-Heme-Hot Spot for KIT D816V) mutation will be helpful for complete evaluation. This case was reviewed with Dr. Caleb Ho, who agrees with the diagnosis. 

BONE MARROW BIOPSY
Quality: Adequate.
Cellularity: Mildly hypercellular for age, approximately 80%
M:E ratio: Within normal limits. 
Blasts: Not increased. 
Myeloid lineage: Exhibits full maturation.
Erythroid lineage: Exhibits full maturation. 
Megakaryocytes: Adequate in number with mostly unremarkable morphology. 
Lymphocytes: Scattered. 
Plasma cells: Scattered. 
Other: Few small aggregates of atypical mast cells with spindled morphology and many admixed eosinophils. 
Special stains: Reticulin stain shows no increase in reticulin fibrosis.

Promyelocytes 4%
Myelocytes 14%
Metamyelocytes 10%
Neutrophils/Bands 23%
Monocytes 1%
Eosinophils 5%
Erythroid Precursors 23%

Morphology:
Paucispicular and hypocellular smears show maturing trilineage hematopoiesis. There is no increase in blasts. Myeloid and erythroid elements are adequate in proportion with progressive maturation and mostly unremarkable morphology. Few megakaryocytes are present and show mostly unremarkable morphology. Rare scattered atypical mast cells are seen. 

PERIPHERAL BLOOD
No CBC available within 7 days.
Morphology: No peripheral blood smear available.

IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY
CD34 and CD117 stains show scattered blasts, overall <5% of total cellularity. 
CD117 and Tryptase stains highlight few small aggregates of mast cells, which co-express CD2 and CD25, and involving <5% of marrow cellularity.
CD3 stain highlights scattered small T-cells.
CD20 stain highlights few scattered small B-cells. 

FLOW CYTOMETRIC ANALYSIS, BONE MARROW (F19-6585)
Atypical mast cell population seen with expression of CD2 and CD25. The population represents 0.031% of WBC.
No definite abnormal myeloid blast, monocyte or maturing myeloid populations detected. 
No abnormal mature B- or T-cell populations detected.

There is no definite immunophenotypic evidence of a myeloid stem cell disorder by flow cytometry. However, in light of the HLA-DR (dim) and CD25 (small subset), a low-grade myelodysplastic syndrome or myeloproliferative disorder cannot be entirely excluded by these studies. CD34 positive myeloid blasts represent 0.84% of the white blood cells. Normal myelomonocytic maturation is present. 431,069 cells acquired. Not all myeloid stem cell disorders show abnormal immunophenotype with this assessment and correlation with additional studies (morphologic, cytogenetic, and molecular) is required.

No immunophenotypic evidence of involvement by B- or T-cell lymphoma or leukemia is identified. Hodgkin lymphoma would not be detected by these studies.

FLOW CYTOMETRIC ANALYSIS, PERIPHERAL BLOOD
Not available.

CYTOGENETIC STUDIES (CG19-4623)
KARYOTYPE ANALYSIS:
Normal female karyotype. No evidence of clonal chromosome abnormality was observed.

FISH ANALYSIS:
No evidence of PDGFRA/FIP1L1 (4q12) rearrangement.

MOLECULAR STUDIES 
Molecular analysis will be reported separately. See separate report, M19-25709.
